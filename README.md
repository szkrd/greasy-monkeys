# greasy-monkeys

Tampermonkey scripts for Chromium or whatever browser can parse them.

The scripts are meant to be used along with _uBlock Origin_ (adblocker and antisocial filter set).
Adblocking, unless a site tries to warn me or annoys the hell out of me, is not a priority.

I usually:

- mute colors
- remove sponsored content
- filter things and people I don't like
- kill popups if possible
- delete sidebars, carousels, animations
- hide comment buttons and all social things
